You realize that the car's design is not just about looks, it's about how the car's technology works in conjunction with the car's exterior.\n\nAs you continue driving, you notice that the car's body contours change with every curve in the road. You can see the car's sensors and cameras working in unison to create a seamless and seamless experience for you. Every time you turn a corner, the car's sensors detect the change in your surroundings and adjust the car's acceleration, braking, and steering accordingly.\n\nAs you approach your destination, you can see how the car's sensors and cameras work in tandem to create an immersive and interactive environment.
